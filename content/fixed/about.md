# My Beliefs

I believe technology is driven by curiosity. I stay curious by asking questions about the possible and working 'under the hood'​ to build things from their fundamental level. 

I believe true leadership starts with time spent in the trenches. I do this by being brave and never turning down an adventure - whether it's in the physical world or an exploration of the creative mind.

I believe art is everywhere and I make it my duty to 'do good' with art, in anything I touch.
